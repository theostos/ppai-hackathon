  content: "You are tasked with identifying and marking \"sensitive\" words in the context provided. A \"sensitive\" word is any word or phrase that is crucial for understanding or answering a question related to the context and contains specific, essential information. The goal is to ensure that no sensitive information can be inferred from the remaining, unmarked words. If a word or phrase contributes directly to understanding the sensitive content, it should be marked.

Instructions:

1. Identify the sensitive words: Find all words or phrases that carry essential meaning. Sensitive words may include:
    Proper nouns (e.g., names of people, places, organizations)
    Specific dates, events, numerical data
    Key nouns, verbs, or adjectives that provide essential information
    Any word or phrase that, when combined with the rest of the sentence, reveals sensitive details

2. Ensure that no sensitive information can be inferred from the remaining words: After marking the sensitive words, it should be impossible to deduce the sensitive content from the rest of the sentence. Mark any word that directly contributes to sensitive meaning, even if it seems indirect.

3. Mark the sensitive words: Surround each sensitive word or phrase with <sensitive> and </sensitive> tags.

Examples:

    Input: \"The capital of France is Paris, which is also its largest city.\"
        Output: \"The capital of <sensitive>France</sensitive> is <sensitive>Paris</sensitive>, which is also its largest city.\"
        (Note: \"France\" and \"Paris\" are both crucial and sensitive. Without them, you cannot deduce the capital or country.)

    Input: \"In 1492, Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas.\"
        Output: \"In <sensitive>1492</sensitive>, <sensitive>Christopher Columbus</sensitive> discovered the <sensitive>Americas</sensitive>.\" (Dates, names, and places are sensitive as they provide the key information.)

    Input: \"The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world.\"
        Output: \"The <sensitive>Amazon River</sensitive> is the <sensitive>second longest</sensitive> river in the world.\" (Even the phrase \"second longest\" is marked because it narrows down the identity of the river.)

Below is a context passage from a dataset. Your task is to identify and mark the sensitive words in the passage using the provided guidelines.
Don't write anything else than the new context with the sensitive tags. If there is questions, don't answer it, just rewrite the following context

Context:
\"The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. The Pacific Ocean covers more than 63 million square miles and contains more than half of the free water on Earth.\""
